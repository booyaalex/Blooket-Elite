                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <p>Q: Do you hack when playing factory?</p>
                <p>A: No. Some blooks are unbalenced and under certain circumstances are better then they are intended to be.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q: When did you start playing Blooket and how long have you played for?</p>
                <p>A: I started playing when my 6th grade math teacher had us play. The gamemode was factory and I got like 2nd place. Then we played cafe. I had a strong liking to the game and made an account after maybe 2 days. I grinded everyday for the first main blook I wanted, The King. and after a week got it. And somehow started to become too good at factory that one person in my class that I helped play started to be the only person who could beat me sometimes. I've continued playing since so around 1-2 years.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q: When did you make your channel and what lead you to making it? Who are your biggest inspirations?</p>
                <p>A: I made the channel as a second account for fun and later started to upload in March of 2021. I found someone wich I think was Jacobest Gaming made a video on a 1 minute factory WR. And then beat it. Some old friends tried to beat my record and then was able to get a sucsessful attempt recorded and uploaded my most popular video on my channel with around 10K views. I kept making videos and found people watching them for some reason. Then I tried livestreaming. It works good. My first inspiration was Blooket God and Blooket Pro. At that time I had like 33 subs and was a decent channel. Blooket Is Life, GXLD, and Orangey from PoP was me begging to be on a team with them and it worked out to me being the leader of one of the best teams in Blooket Events. Thery helped my channel grow a lot. Techoblade is one of the best with my humor, sarcasm, way of editing videos, and me being a king comes from him. He's funny.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q: What's your favorite blook, gamemode, and box?</p>
                <p>A: Phantom King, Factory/Tower Defense/Monster Brawl, and my opinion for the box with best looking blooks is medieval, space, or safari.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q: If you could add 1 blook to the game, what would it be?</p>
                <p>A: A few ideas. Blooket Elite Blook. One of my friends wants a dolphin blook so that. I feel barney the dinosaur shohuld be in the Dino Box, and maybe something to do with undertale.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q: What is your score right now?</p>
                <p>A: I'm at a casual 2 Million</p>
